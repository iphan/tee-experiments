"""MMLU subject -> broad-category mapping.

Embedded from the official MMLU repo (``hendrycks/test/categories.py``): the
``subcategories`` mapping (subject -> fine-grained domain) and the four broad
``categories``. The mapping is stable across MMLU releases, so it is embedded
here rather than fetched at runtime. Broad-category display names follow the
TEE data spec (STEM / Humanities / Social Sciences / Other).
